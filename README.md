# Rocha's knowledge bot, domain Artificial Intelligence

Visit the site <https://fititnt.github.io/rocha-knowledge-bot>.

## Motivation

I am looking for how to reconcile my work and personal and family life and still educate people, especially Latin Americans, about ethics in automation and mischievous intelligence.

Assuming the obvious question that this is a huge job, and that there are more basic and generalist issues that affect everyone, I'd rather stick to issues that other people can not do until Ethics.AI itself is "an organism that works even though parties from him fail".

I'm a human, and talking to people gives a lot of work. Human interaction, seeing the human face, is something important in communication. The point is to have ways of giving my opinion on certain subjects more dynamically.

Another problem is this: I, being a human, can also fail. So even I could benefit from a copy of my own knowledge when I need to give an answer. This could allow me, who have ADHD, not to medicate me to give an answer for fear of making a mistake.

## One way to do it

I am prototyping questions and quick answers on the subject artificial intelligence. For me as well as other people who want to talk to me, it may be faster to press control + F and search for a term on a web page than to call me in a private chat or make a call.

One advantage of creating a knowledge base is that colleagues could discuss directly in my full line of reasoning in the future. For now it's literally search with coltrol + F on the page.

To ask "why a bot with your name?" Not something with another person's name or generic name? The answer is: this is a prototype. There are not enough people around me who know about sensitive topics about artificial intelligence. This may change in the future.
